<!-- READ THIS FIRST:
  Hi. Thanks for using the integration. 
  Before submitting a feature request please review the following:
  - Search or browse the existing open and closed issues for your request.
  - Please explain how the function or feature should work, and how it interacts with other modes of operation, fan speeds, and/or presets.
  - Provide screenshots of the OEM application demonstrating the function if possible.
  - Be available for testing! Most often I cannot test this function and therefore YOU will need to be the beta tester for this feature.
